Long-form collections in EmProps Studio allow artists to mint a set of instructions used in real-time image generation on blockchain platforms like Tezos and Ethereum. This guide will walk you through the process of publishing your long-form collection to make it accessible for minting and distribution.

* Enable Batch Minting (if available): This option allows multiple tokens to be minted at once, up to the “Max Tokens Per Mint” limit you set.
* Encrypt Instruction Set: Encrypt your collection’s instruction set to keep your project settings and assets private upon publication. Enter a strong password for encryption.
