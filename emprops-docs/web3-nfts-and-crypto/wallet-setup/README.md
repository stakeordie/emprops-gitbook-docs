# üè¶ Wallet Setup



For Tezos, we will be using Temple. However, other wallets exist, such as Kukai.



## Wallet Setup

### Install Temple Extension

[https://templewallet.com/download](https://templewallet.com/download)

If you have an existing Temple Wallet account click on import existing wallet. You will want to get your seed phrase or recovery file.

We will assume that you are adding Temple for the first time.

Select ‚ÄúCreate a new Wallet‚Äù

Click on the area that says ‚ÄúProtected‚Äù and write down the seed phrase.

Next check ‚ÄúI made Seed Phrase backup‚Äù and click ‚ÄúNext‚Äù

After confirming that seed phrase, set a password and skip onboarding.

At this point you should have the temple wallet extension fully configured and ready to use.\

Do note that to use Tezos, a fee is required (called gas), so make sure you add a bit of tezos to your wallet from another source first before trying to mint.
