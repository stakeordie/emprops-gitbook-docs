# Curated Collections

### What are Curated Collections?

Within the EmProps Marketplace, certain projects are curated with a meticulous, white-glove approach by the EmProps team. These projects often feature unique attributes and design elements that are exclusive to these collections. Such exclusive offerings are termed as Curated Collections. These collections receive special prominence and can be accessed through the main 'Emergent Properties' gallery on the EmProps platform, offering a distinct and elevated experience for collectors and enthusiasts alike.
