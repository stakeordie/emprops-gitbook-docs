# Storefronts

In addition to individual collections and profile pages, the EmProps Marketplace facilitates StoreFrontsâ€”a unique feature that allows organizations to curate multiple collections under a single, cohesive page. This enables organizations to present a unified front for their various collections, enhancing visibility and structure.

Currently, the EmProps Marketplace hosts StoreFronts for MemberTokens and the SuperChief gallery collections, presenting users with a curated array of works from these entities. These StoreFronts serve as dedicated spaces where users can explore a variety of collections curated under specific themes or organizational umbrellas, providing a streamlined and captivating browsing experience.
