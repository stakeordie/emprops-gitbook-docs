# Getting Help

### There are several avenues by which we can support you:

#### Intercom

If you couldn't find the information you were looking for in our documentation, don't hesitate to reach out to our team via our main support network, Intercom. You can reach out to our team directly from within the EmProps Studio via the Intercom icon in the bottom-right of your screen. It looks like \*this\*![](../../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

#### Discord Community

Intercom is currently only available via the EmProps website, so if you do not yet have access, you can also get help by joining our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/z2s7QNAhqG). Here, you can open a support ticket via the [#ticket-tool-support-feedback channel](https://discord.com/channels/903275591208427641/1136298334064214107), and our team will help you out as soon as possible.

#### Email

If Discord or Intercom are not your cup of tea, you can always reach out to our support team via support@emprops.ai. The turnaround time on emails is a bit slower than the other methods.

#### Documentation Feedback

We're constantly looking to improve our documentation. If you have suggestions or find any errors, please let us know on Intercom or Discord. Your input helps us make EmProps better for everyone!
