# How to get support?

When you encounter issues or have questions while using EmProps OpenStudio, accessing support is straightforward and user-centric. EmProps offers two primary ways to get the help you need: through our integrated Intercom node and our dedicated Discord server. Hereâ€™s how to use these resources effectively.

### Option 1: Using the Intercom Node <a href="#h_a01de03634" id="h_a01de03634"></a>

For immediate assistance and a direct line to our support team, use the Intercom node within OpenStudio. Hereâ€™s how to access it:

### Steps to Use Intercom: <a href="#h_a8987ff3f1" id="h_a8987ff3f1"></a>

1. Access Intercom: Navigate to any page within EmProps OpenStudio. Youâ€™ll find the Intercom icon in the bottom-right corner of the screen.
2. Initiate Chat: Click on the icon to open a chat window. This service connects you directly to a live support agent.
3. Describe Your Issue: Clearly state your problem or question in the chat. Providing details such as screenshots, steps youâ€™ve already tried, and what you are trying to achieve will help the support team assist you more effectively.
4. Follow Up: Once your initial query is sent, our team will respond promptly. Keep the chat window open for live interaction, or you can come back to it when you receive a notification of a response.

Using the Intercom node ensures that you get quick responses and can have a real-time conversation about your issue, making it the most efficient way to resolve immediate concerns.

### Option 2: Discord Support Channel <a href="#h_a5c1bb5a4d" id="h_a5c1bb5a4d"></a>

If you prefer to use Discord or require more detailed assistance that may involve community feedback, our Discord server is the right choice. Hereâ€™s how to reach out:
