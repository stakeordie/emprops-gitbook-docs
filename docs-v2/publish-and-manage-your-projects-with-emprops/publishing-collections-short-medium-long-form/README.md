# Short/Medium/Long-Form Collections

Generative art comes in a variety of formats. There's **long-form** art, where artists publish their algorithms directly, giving up control over the outputs and allowing the outputs to be generated in real-time.

There's also **short-form** collections, where artists create algorithms, curate the outputs, and then publish their creations with intention and sequence.

Artists have expressed a desire for a balance between these two approaches, which is why we have introduced a new format: **Medium-form!**

Medium-form projects allow the artist to select a collection of curated outputs and loads them into a sort of 'gumball machine.' When a collector mints a piece from a medium-form collection, they receive a randomly selected work that has been curated by the artist.
