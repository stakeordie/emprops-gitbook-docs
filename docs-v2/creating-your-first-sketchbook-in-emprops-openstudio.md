# üê£ Creating Your First Collection in EmProps Studio

Welcome to EmProps Studio! This guide will walk you through the process of creating your first sketchbook, which is your personal space to manage and generate AI-powered images.

### Step 1: Accessing the Studio <a href="#h_ca54d44df8" id="h_ca54d44df8"></a>

First, ensure you are logged into your EmProps account. From the Studio home page, log in with either your email, wallet, or another log-in option.

### Step 2: The Project Directory <a href="#h_256bc28cd0" id="h_256bc28cd0"></a>

Once in Studio, the first page you will see is the Project Directory.

The Studio Project Directory is the central hub for organizing and managing all your project projects. Users can view, create, and manage project here, providing an organized workspace for various projects. Each project can contain multiple pages of variations.

### Step 3: Create a New Project <a href="#h_14a241ad40" id="h_14a241ad40"></a>

To begin a new project:

1. Click on the "Create Project" button. This is typically found at the top of the Sketchbook Directory page or within the "New" menu dropdown.

### Step 4: Setting Up Your Project <a href="#h_cd65f60373" id="h_cd65f60373"></a>

After creating your project, you‚Äôll be taken to its main page. Here, you can:

* **Add Pages**\
  Each page can represent a different aspect or variant of your project. Click on ‚ÄúDuplicate Page‚Äù to create a checkpoint of your current state, so you can revert to an older version in the future.
*   #### Naming Your Project and Pages

    Click the 'Untitled' text in the top-left corner to rename your project or page. Choose a name that reflects its theme or purpose, like ‚ÄúNature Landscapes‚Äù or ‚ÄúFuturistic Cities.‚Äù
* **Manage Variables:**\
  If you'd like your project to contain specific variables, such as text strings, images, or custom seeds, you can define and manage these through the [variables editor](using-variables-in-emprops-openstudio.md).
* NOTE: The ["Studio Project Page"](openstudio-project-page.md) article describes the Studio's features in greater detail.

### Step 5: Customizing Project Settings <a href="#h_175ca24d6c" id="h_175ca24d6c"></a>

In the project settings, you can set up various parameters that will influence how your images are generated. This includes:

* Prompt: Define what you want your AI to create with a descriptive text.
* IMG2IMG settings: If you're converting existing images, toggle the IMG2IMG feature.
* Dimensions: Specify the width and height for your generated images.
* Sampling Method and Steps: Choose how detailed and refined the AI's rendering should be.

### Step 6: Save and Generate <a href="#h_72d38b5528" id="h_72d38b5528"></a>

Once you‚Äôve configured your settings:

1. Save your project settings by clicking **‚ÄúSave Changes.‚Äù**
2. Select the number of iterations you would like to generate under 'Setup', and start generating images by clicking **‚ÄúGenerate.‚Äù**

### Step 7: Viewing and Managing Outputs <a href="#h_c8b32ffddb" id="h_c8b32ffddb"></a>

After generation, view your images in the ‚ÄúOutputs‚Äù section of your Project. Here, you can:

* **Download Images:** \
  Save the generated images to your local device via the **Download** button.
* **Save to FlatFIles:**\
  Press **Save to FlatFiles** to save your image to the platform. Assets saved to your FlatFiles can be used in Studio projects.
