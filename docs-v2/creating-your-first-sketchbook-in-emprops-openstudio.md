# Creating Your First Sketchbook in EmProps OpenStudio

Welcome to EmProps OpenStudio! This guide will walk you through the process of creating your first sketchbook, which is your personal space to manage and generate AI-powered images.

### Step 1: Accessing OpenStudio <a href="#h_ca54d44df8" id="h_ca54d44df8"></a>

First, ensure you are logged into your EmProps account. From the OpenStudio home page, log in with either your email, wallet, or another log-in option.

### Step 2: The Sketchbook Directory <a href="#h_256bc28cd0" id="h_256bc28cd0"></a>

Once in OpenStudio, the first page you will see is the Sketchbook Directory. This is your central hub for all your projects. You can view and manage existing sketchbooks here or start a new one from scratch or from a Template.

### Step 3: Create a New Sketchbook <a href="#h_14a241ad40" id="h_14a241ad40"></a>

To begin a new project:

1. Click on the "Create Sketchbook" button. This is typically found at the top of the Sketchbook Directory page or within the "New" menu dropdown.

### Step 4: Setting Up Your Sketchbook <a href="#h_cd65f60373" id="h_cd65f60373"></a>

After creating your sketchbook, you’ll be taken to its main page. Here, you can:

* Add Pages: Each page can represent a different aspect or variant of your project. Click on “Add Page” to start customizing your first page.
* Name Your Sketchbook and Pages: By clicking the 'Untitled' text in the top-left, you can modify the name of your project or current page. Choose a name that reflects the theme or purpose of your projects, such as “Nature Landscapes” or “Futuristic Cities.”
* Manage Variables: If you'd like your project to contain specific variables, such as text strings, images, or custom seeds, you can define and manage these through the variables editor.

### Step 5: Customizing Project Settings <a href="#h_175ca24d6c" id="h_175ca24d6c"></a>

In the project settings, you can set up various parameters that will influence how your images are generated. This includes:

* Prompt: Define what you want your AI to create with a descriptive text.
* IMG2IMG settings: If you're converting existing images, toggle the IMG2IMG feature.
* Dimensions: Specify the width and height for your generated images.
* Sampling Method and Steps: Choose how detailed and refined the AI's rendering should be.

### Step 6: Save and Generate <a href="#h_72d38b5528" id="h_72d38b5528"></a>

Once you’ve configured your settings:

1. Save your project settings by clicking “Save Changes.”
2. Select the number of iterations you would like to generate under 'Setup', and start generating images by clicking “Generate”.

### Step 7: Viewing and Managing Outputs <a href="#h_c8b32ffddb" id="h_c8b32ffddb"></a>

After generation, view your images in the “Outputs” section of your sketchbook. Here, you can:

* Download Images: Save the generated images to your local device or to FlatFiles for future use.
* Edit or Re-generate: Make adjustments to your settings and re-generate images if needed.
