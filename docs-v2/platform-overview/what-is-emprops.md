  really liked the way it sounds. EmProps is a platform where artists can make,

# What is EmProps

###

## Introduction

EmProps is made up of two applications that work hand in hand.

[OpenStudio](broken-reference), a creativity studio for the era of AI and automation, and

[OpenMarket](broken-reference), a minting platform and marketplace for your OpenStudio creations.

Currently these two apps are pretty distinct, which is admittedly confusing, and we are working to unify them.
