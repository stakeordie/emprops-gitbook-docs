## EmProps Marketplace Overview

The EmProps Marketplace is an extensive digital platform that features profile pages showcasing a wide range of artists' collections and their collected works. Each artist's profile provides an in-depth look at their contributions and creative journey within the EmProps ecosystem.

### Curated Collections

Within the EmProps Marketplace, certain projects are curated with a meticulous, white-glove approach by the EmProps team. These projects often feature unique attributes and design elements that are exclusive to these collections. Such exclusive offerings are termed as Curated Collections. These collections receive special prominence and can be accessed through the main 'Emergent Properties' gallery on the EmProps platform, offering a distinct and elevated experience for collectors and enthusiasts alike.

### StoreFronts

In addition to individual collections and profile pages, the EmProps Marketplace facilitates StoreFronts‚Äîa unique feature that allows organizations to curate multiple collections under a single, cohesive page. This enables organizations to present a unified front for their various collections, enhancing visibility and structure.

Currently, the EmProps Marketplace hosts StoreFronts for MemberTokens and the SuperChief gallery collections, presenting users with a curated array of works from these entities. These StoreFronts serve as dedicated spaces where users can explore a variety of collections curated under specific themes or organizational umbrellas, providing a streamlined and captivating browsing experience.
