# EmProps Marketplace

The EmProps Marketplace contains profile pages showcasing artists' collections and collected works. \
\
Some projects are created with a white-glove apparoach with the EmProps team and may have features that are unique to just those projects. These collections are called Curated Collections, and are available via the EmProps main 'Emergent Properties' gallery. \
There are also StoreFronts which are a way for organizations to curate multiple collections under one special page. Currently we have a StoreFronts Page for MemberTokens and for the SuperChief gallery collections.
