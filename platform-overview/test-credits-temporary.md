# Test Credits (Temporary)

### Restrictions

Test credits can not be used to publish collections. The only peopl who can publish during public beta are PatronPass and MemberToken holders.

### What are credits?

Credits represent the usage of scarce compute resources. The goal is to make it so that 1 credit is enough to generate 1 - 1024x1024 image. This should equate to something like 10 seconds of compute time.

### What are Test Credits?

Test credits are free credits to be used ahead of the public beta launch. The exist for us to get a sense of how people use them and make sure our system is pefect before charging money.

### How do I get and use test credits?

Each member with OpenStudio access will get a beginning supply of 500 credits. This is a little less than a $5-6 membership should get on a monthly basis. If and when you used them up, you will need to "buy" more. But don't worry it won't cost you anything \

You can use any of these test credit card numbers in the field to process the test credit 'transaction'. \
