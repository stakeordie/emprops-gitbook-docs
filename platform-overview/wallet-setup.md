### Configure Custom (Ghostnet) Network

Out of the box Temple provides a connection to the Tezos Mainnet, as well as various testnets.

EmProps OpenStudio Private Alpha is built on Ghostnet which is an option. However the default node that Temple connects to leaves a lot to be desired speed and reliability wise. So, we are going to add a custom node that will work way better.

Click on the image next to the account name.
