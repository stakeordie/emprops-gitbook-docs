# üñºÔ∏è Publishing Collections (Short, Medium, Long-form)

[**Long-Form**](../docs-v2/publishing-long-form-collections-in-emprops-openstudio.md) collections allow artists to publish their algorithms directly, giving up control over the outputs and allowing them to be generated in real-time upon mint.

[**Medium-Form**](../docs-v2/publishing-a-medium-form-collection-on-emprops-openstudio.md) projects allow artists to curate a collection of outputs and distribute them in a random order to collectors upon mint.&#x20;

With [**Short-Form**](../docs-v2/publish-and-manage-your-projects-with-emprops/publishing-collections-short-medium-long-form/copy-of-publishing-a-medium-form-collection-on-emprops-studio.md) collections (exclusive to tezos), artists publish individual 1-of-1 creations with intention and sequence. There is no randomization with short-form, as each artwork is minted one at a time.

Each collection type has a specific use-case, giving you full control over how you publish your work.
