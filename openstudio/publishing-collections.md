We describe EmProps OpenStudio is an End-to-End creativity platform. What we mean by this is that we provide tools both to generate creative output and then put it out into the world to create value for the creator. What this means in practice is that an artist can sell the work they create in the OpenStudio in the OpenMarket.

\<aside> ðŸ‘€ This doc is focused on publishing to the OpenMarket on [EmProps.ai](http://emprops.ai), but the future vision goes beyond the OpenMarket and beyond blockchain.

We are working to create numerous publication options. These will include other marketplace, hosted galleries, and off-chain destinations such as social media and IRL fabrication and sales. Th

When you publish to testnet you are create a collection either on Tezos Ghostnet or ETH Sepolia and for now is password protected for OpenStudio members. Mainnet is public for everyone to see and its is for real funds.

For the first part of this tutorial we will focus on testnet publishing as it is highly recommended that you experiment on testnet before publishing to mainnet. After going through the process on testnet, we will highlight the differences with mainnet.

### Connecting & adding your wallet(s)

When you publish you will first need to connect your wallet. If you havenâ€™t you will see this error:

After connecting you may see this error:

This means that you need to verify and add you wallet to your account in the settings.

Once the connected wallet is added to your account you are ready to publish with it.
