# Publishing

Publishing a project is the process of actually minting your Open Studio creation onto the blockchain. In this case publishing is pushed to the Tezos Ghostnet and onto our test site [https://testnet.emprops.ai/](https://testnet.emprops.ai/).

### How to publish a project

1. Once you are satisfied with your project look for the publish button located on the bottom right

1. You will have to be logged into your Ghostnet Tezos or Etherium wallet, and from here you will find a few fields to modify:

* Project Name - The name of your project.
* Description - A description of your project. You can include any additional context in here.
  * Note: At the moment, the project names and descriptions are limited to basic text characters.
* Price - Set the price of each edition, ensuring that you take into account the price in tezos or etherium.
* Editions - Set the total number of editions to be minted from your project
* Royalty %
  * note: EmProps takes zero royalties from the artists.

1. Once you have filled out your project details simply hit Publish and accept the transaction once it appears in your wallet app.
2. Your work will now appear on the website and can be minted! [https://testnet.emprops.ai/community-projects](https://testnet.emprops.ai/community-projects)
