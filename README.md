  EmProps is short for Emergent Properties; at first it was just our URL, but we
  really liked the way it sounds. EmProps is a platform where artists can make,
  distribute, and sell a new kind of Gen Art.

# Welcome to EmProps!

## Introduction

EmProps is made up of two applications that work hand in hand.

EmProps Studio, a creativity studio for the era of AI and automation, and

EmProps Marketplace, a minting platform and marketplace for your creations and projects.

Currently these two apps are distinct, however we are working to unify them in the near future.
